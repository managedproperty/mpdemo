      <h2>Established in 2009</h2>
      <p>Managed Property was born from the trust our commercial clients placed in us—many of whom asked us to bring the same level of care and capability to their residential investments. From day one, we’ve carried a reputation for reliability, expertise, and practical problem-solving. In short: we’re safe hands.</p>

      <h3>Property Management, Done Properly</h3>
      <p>We’re not your average agency. With a dedicated team based in Hamilton, Brisbane, our central location allows us to service a broad range of properties with confidence and consistency. We don’t take on managements just to boost numbers—if a property falls outside the area we can reliably support, we’ll say no. For us, it’s about doing the job properly—or not at all.</p>

      <p>Our approach is proactive, communication-driven, and fully backed by smart, cloud-based systems that make property management easier for everyone involved. Whether you’re a local owner or living overseas, we keep you informed and in control—without the stress.</p>

      <p>We also keep our property-to-staff ratio lower than most, so your investment gets the attention it deserves—not just when something goes wrong.</p>

      <h3>Transparent, Fair Fees</h3>
      <p>Our fee structure is simple and transparent. Whether it’s ongoing management or letting your property, our pricing reflects the time, care, and expertise involved—nothing hidden, nothing excessive. We take the time to secure the right tenant, ensure compliance, and manage your investment properly from start to finish.</p>
