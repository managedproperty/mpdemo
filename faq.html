      <h3>Do you advertise on realestate.com.au and domain.com.au?</h3>
      <p>Yes. All rental listings are advertised as Premiere Listings on realestate.com.au—the highest-ranking option for maximum exposure. We also list on domain.com.au and other major platforms as Standard Listings.</p>
      <p>Through our subscription arrangement, we’re able to pass on significant savings to property owners—keeping your marketing cost low, with a capped fee of $221 incl. GST when a new campaign is required.</p>

      <h3>Do you thoroughly screen tenants?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. We require detailed documentation, complete reference checks and tenancy database searches, and present a clear summary and recommendation for your approval. A strong tenant benefits both you and us.</p>

      <h3>Do you manage council rates, water bills, and body corporate levies?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Once authorised, we process these invoices from the rent collected and itemise them clearly in your disbursement statement.</p>

      <h3>Do you provide end-of-financial-year statements?</h3>
      <p>Yes, and they’re emailed to you at no additional cost.</p>

      <h3>Do you handle maintenance issues?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We coordinate all repairs through a network of qualified, reliable contractors—built over years of experience. We do not accept referral fees, and repairs are paid from the rent collected.</p>

      <h3>How are your management fees calculated?</h3>
      <p>We charge a flat weekly fee based on the size and complexity of your property. This allows us to deliver high-quality service without surprises.</p>
