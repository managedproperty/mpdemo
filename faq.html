      <h2>Landlord FAQs</h2>

      <h3>How do you find tenants?</h3>
      <p>We advertise online via realestate.com.au and domain.com.au, as well as social media. We use high quality photography and engaging ad copy to generate enquiries. All enquiries are logged and followed up via our booking system for inspections and applications.</p>

      <h3>How do you screen tenants?</h3>
      <p>Each application is checked thoroughly using the National Tenancy Database, identity verification, income and affordability calculations, rental history, employer references, and personal references. Each application is presented to the owner for final approval.</p>

      <h3>Do you do routine inspections?</h3>
      <p>Yes, our team completes a detailed Entry Condition Report before tenancy, routine inspections every 3–4 months, and a full Exit Condition Report after vacating. Photos and documentation are stored digitally and shared with landlords.</p>

      <h3>How do you handle maintenance?</h3>
      <p>Tenants can lodge maintenance requests online 24/7. Our team reviews every request and coordinates trusted, insured tradespeople to carry out work with the owner’s approval.</p>

      <h3>What are your fees?</h3>
      <p>Our management fee is percentage-based and competitive with the Brisbane market. We believe in simple, fair pricing and full transparency. Contact us for a detailed breakdown based on your property.</p>

      <h2>Tenant FAQs</h2>

      <h3>How do I apply for a property?</h3>
      <p>You can apply online via realestate.com.au (preferred) or use our online application form. We recommend attending an inspection and submitting all supporting documents with your application to avoid delays.</p>

      <h3>When is rent due?</h3>
      <p>Rent is due in advance and paid electronically. Tenants can access their ledger, lease, and maintenance requests via the tenant portal.</p>

      <h3>How do I report maintenance?</h3>
      <p>Use our online maintenance form 24/7 for both routine and urgent issues. Our team will review and action your request during business hours.</p>

      <h3>What happens at the end of my lease?</h3>
      <p>You’ll be contacted prior to your lease end to discuss renewal options. If you wish to vacate, you'll need to provide notice as per the Residential Tenancies Authority (RTA) requirements.</p>
