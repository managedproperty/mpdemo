      <h2>Make the Switch Simple</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We contact your current agent</strong> (no awkward calls required)</li>
        <li><strong>We collect all keys and documentation</strong> on your behalf</li>
        <li><strong>We review the existing lease and tenant details</strong></li>
        <li><strong>We introduce ourselves to your tenants</strong> with contact details, payment instructions, and a check-in</li>
        <li><strong>We schedule a routine inspection</strong> so we’re up to speed from day one</li>

      <h2>Property Management, Done Properly</h2>
      <p>We’re experts in Property and Tenancy Management—with deep knowledge of legislation, strong communication, and a collaborative approach.</p>
      <p>Our team is made up of real people, based right here in Brisbane—not offshore. We're down-to-earth, proactive, and genuinely enjoy working together. With a lower property-to-staff ratio than most agencies, we’re not stretched thin—so your investment receives the attention it deserves.</p>

      <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A dedicated property manager who knows your property and acts as your main point of contact—supported by our leasing and admin team to ensure nothing slips through the cracks</li>
        <li>Clear financial reporting and proactive rent collection</li>
        <li>Prompt, professional maintenance coordination</li>
        <li>Routine inspections with detailed feedback—not just generic photos</li>
        <li>Practical problem-solvers—we’re not afraid to tighten a screw ourselves, and our troubleshooting skills often save clients hundreds in unnecessary call-out fees</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Our Clients Stay</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Most of our new business comes through referrals from happy clients</li>
        <li>Tenants actively choose to stay with us—even across multiple properties</li>
        <li>We manage tenancies that have lasted over 10 years</li>
        <li>One long-term tenant is now in their third property with our office</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Landlords Choose Us</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparent, timely communication</li>
        <li>No hidden fees or vague processes</li>
        <li>Action-oriented approach to arrears and maintenance</li>
        <li>A smoother experience for owners, tenants, and trades alike</li>
